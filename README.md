## 📂 Dataset Description & Data Structure  

### 📌 Data Source  
- Source: (Mention where the dataset is obtained from—Kaggle, company database, government sources, etc.)  
- Size: (Mention the number of rows & columns)  
- Format: (.csv, .sql, .xlsx, etc.)  

### 📊 Data Structure & Relationships  

#### 1️⃣ Tables Used:  
Mention how many tables are in the dataset.  Only mention tables that you actually used from the entire dataset. 

#### 2️⃣ Table Schema & Data Snapshot  

Table 1: Products Table  

👉🏻 Insert a screenshot of table schema. if table is too long, only show a snapshot of it. Recommend to put it in a toggle format

 _Example:_

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |  
|-------------|----------|-------------|  
| Product_ID  | INT      | Unique identifier for each product |  
| Name        | TEXT     | Product name |  
| Category    | TEXT     | Product category |  
| Price       | FLOAT    | Price per unit |  



Table 2: Sales Transactions  

👉🏻 Insert a screenshot of table schema. if table is too long, only show a snapshot of it. Recommend to put it in a toggle format


 _Example:_

| Column Name    | Data Type | Description |  
|---------------|----------|-------------|  
| Transaction_ID | INT      | Unique identifier for each sale |  
| Product_ID     | INT      | Foreign key linking to Products table |  
| Quantity       | INT      | Number of items sold |  
| Sale_Date      | DATE     | Date of transaction |  


**_📌If the table is too big, only capture a part of it that contains key metrics you used in the projects or put the table in toggle_**

## ⚒️ Main Process

**_📌If your project involves SQL as 1st part of data preprocessing, do this part, or else you can skip this part and jump directly into the Visualization part_**

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3️⃣ SQL/ Python Analysis 

- In each step, show your Code

- Include query/ code execution screenshots or result samples

- Explain its purpose and its findings


4️⃣ Power BI Visualization  (applicable for PBI Projects)
